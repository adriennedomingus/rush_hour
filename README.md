This was a project for Module 2 at the Turing School of Software and Design. The app receives payloads through CURL requests. It then parses them and provides analytics for a client on the basis of their requests, including:

* Number of hits per hour for a specific event
* HTTP verbs used
* Response time analytics
* URLs visited
* And more!

Technologies used include Sinatra, built with a basic MVC model and a Postgres Database
